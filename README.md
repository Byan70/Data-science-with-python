## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- `pandas`: Contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts focused on data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library.
- `matplotlib`: Includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for data visualization using the Matplotlib library.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can use virtual environments to 

manage dependencies.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
shell
